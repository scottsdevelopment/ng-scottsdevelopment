<h1>Just another Angular site!</h1>
<p>On my second day of porting the site over I finally figured out how I wanted to do my blog, it took a little bit of research but I was able to come up with some shared components that I can render using direct HTML in my datastore. I am putting everything inside of a flat-file asset folder for now while I keep working on the template.</p>
